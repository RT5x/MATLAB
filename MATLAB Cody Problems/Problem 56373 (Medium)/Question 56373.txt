The density of snow depends on the amount of liquid water it contains:
Dry Snow is about 50 kg/m^3
Wet Snow is about 200 kg/m^3
A typical residential property roof becomes stressed at 98.7 kg/m^2 (20 pounds per square foot) and could collapse at about 145 kg/m^2 (30 pounds per square foot) load (weight) before it collapses.  A deck is typically designed (by code) to withstand 195 to 293 kg/m^2 (40 to 60 pounds of snow per square foot).
For this script, assume that existing snow cover has the density of wet (saturated) snow and that the recent snowfall (past 24 hours and future precipitation) due to a current, steady snowstorm has the density of dry snow.  Also assume that the snowfall is accumulating completely on the roof/deck structure and none is blown, falls, melts, etc. during the snowstorm. 
Write a script that has the following input parameters:
Depth of old, accumulated, saturated snow that existed on the roof at snowstorm onset in centimeters
Rate of snowfall accumulation in current storm in cm/hr.
Duration of the snowstorm in decimal hours
And the following output parameters with some nominal hard-wired stress thresholds:
Load after the snowstorm in kg/m^2
Flag of Roof Structural Status: 0=no concern, 1=stressed (> 98 kg/m^2), 2=might collapse (>145 kg/m^2)
Flag of Deck Structural Status: 0=no concern, 1=stressed (> 195 kg/m^2), 2=might collapse (>293 kg/m^2)
