Each column (except last) of matrix X contains students' scores in a course assignment or a test. The last column has a weighted combination of scores across all the assignments and tests.
Replace the elements in the last column of this matrix with a GPA calculated based on the following scale:
 Score      GPA    
91 - 100   3 - 4      
81 - 90    2 - 3      
71 - 80    1 - 2      
61 - 70    0 - 1      
Below 60     0
Assume that no student in this class has scored below 60. Also note that the mapping in the range [60, 100] is linear.

Input:
   100  90  95  95
