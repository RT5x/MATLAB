Example:
If a system of linear equations in x₁ and x₂ is:
2x₁ + x₂ = 2
x₁ - 4 x₂ = 3
Then the coefficient matrix (A) is:
2  1
1 -4
And the constant vector (b) is:
2
3
To solve this system, use mldivide ( \ ):
x = A\b
Problem:
Given a constant input angle θ (theta) in radians, create the coefficient matrix (A) and constant vector (b) to solve the given system of linear equations in x₁ and x₂.
cos(θ) x₁ + sin(θ) x₂ = 1
-sin(θ) x₁ + cos(θ) x₂ = 1
