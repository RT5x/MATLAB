A Collatz sequence is the sequence where, for a given number n, the next number in the sequence is either n/2 if the number is even or 3n+1 if the number is odd. See Problem 21 for more information.
Let c(n) be the sequence for n, and p(n) be the peak value of that sequence. For a given threshold nmax, find the highest peak value max(p(n)) for all Collatz sequences starting with integers between 1 and nmax.
