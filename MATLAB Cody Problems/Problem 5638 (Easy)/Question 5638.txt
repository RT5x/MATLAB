The NWS Wind Chill Temperature (WCT) index formula for calculating the dangers from winter winds and freezing temperatures:
Calculates wind speed at an average height of 5 feet, the typical height of an adult human face, based on readings from the national standard height of 33 feet, which is the typical height of an anemometer
Is based on a human face model
Incorporates heat transfer theory based on heat loss from the body to its surroundings, during cold and breezy/windy days
Lowers the calm wind threshold to 3 mph
Uses a consistent standard for skin tissue resistance
Assumes no impact from the sun, i.e., clear night sky
       
 Where, 
WindChill = effective temperature (oF)
T = Air Temperature (oF)
V = Wind Speed (mph)
Write a script that calculates the wind chill factor for a given wind speed between 0 and 60 miles per hour and a given temperature between -45 and +45 degrees Farhenheight.  The output values should be rounded to the nearest integer.
