The equation of a damped sinusoid can be written as
y = A.ⅇ^(-λt)*cos(2πft)
where A, λ, and f are scalars and t is a vector.
Calculate the output sinusoid y given the inputs below:
lambda - λ
T - maximum value of t
N - number of elements in t
Assume A = 1 and f = 1 . The vector t should be linearly spaced from 0 to T, with N elements.
