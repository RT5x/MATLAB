here) asserted that readers are relatively insensitive to letter order in words, so long as the first and last letters are unchanged.
Given a string of words s, take each word in turn and reverse the order of letters 2 through n-1, where n is the length of the words. Non-alphabetic characters should remain in place.
So if
 sIn = 'hello'
then
 sOut = 'hlleo'
And if
 sIn = 'This is the first time I have used MATLAB.'
then
 sOut = 'Tihs is the fsrit tmie I hvae uesd MALTAB.'
